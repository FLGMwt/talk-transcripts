I'm Jen. I work with Dev Boot Camp right now. I have spent most of my career as a web designer/developer type person. I'm kind of in that intersection of doing lots of things around that realm, so I don't always know how to describe myself. 

But, I'll tell you my story, though **(slide 2)**. Back in the day, when I was a little kid thinking about what I wanted to be, that wasn't it. For a lot of reasons. The biggest being it didn't really exist then. 

It didn't start to come around, like I didn't know that. I'm 31, I grew up in rural Ohio. Web design didn't exist, and even making interfaces for software applications, which I've also done, was not really something that we did in working class Ohio. It wasn't really an option. So when I was thinking about what I wanted to be when I grew up as you do when you're a little kid and you dream about things like that, I definitely went through lots of phases. 

I went through "I'm gonna be a marine biologist and play with dolphins" and I went through a veterinarian phase too. I have a 7 year old and she's going through all the same ones right now. But eventually what I hit on was something that is not, I've never met anyone else like this, but I decided I wanted to be an animated cartoonist. I really loved cartoons. I was a kid in the very late 80s, early 90s it was the Disney Renaissance, they were doing really great work. I liked to draw, I liked colorful things, I liked this anarchic spirt of anything being able to happen, and so I thought "I should make that! I should be an animator, that sounds awesome". 

So obviously I'm not an animator though, right? That didn't turn out the way I thought it would be. And that's ok, because I like what I do now. But that's been a interesting thing for me recently to think about. Are there any connections between what I thought I wanted to do and what I was drawn to then and what I'm doing now? Are there any lessons that I've learned that I can apply to what I'm doing now? And this is the result of me thinking about things like that. 

There's one person in particular that inspired me both back then and when I started thinking about how I was inspired from these things now there's one person in particular I still went back to, and that was Chuck Jones **(slide 3)**. Does anybody know beyond my description of my talk, who Chuck Jones is? Just out of curiosity. Only a couple of people, that's kind of what I expected, so that's ok. You guys pass, it's all right. 

I have this theory that Chuck Jones is probably one of the most "his work is well-known, but you have no idea who he is" artist of the 20th century, because he was an animated cartoonist for Warner Brothers in the 30s, 40s, 50s, and a little bit of the 60s actually, I think. He was one of the people who helped create Bugs Bunny and Wile E. Coyote, and all of the Looney Tunes cartoons that you watched when you were little, and hopefully when you're older too because they're really great. He was one of the people who shaped all that and did that. 

There are lots of people who did that, he wasn't the only one who did, but he was the only one who really wrote about it. He lived into his 80s or 90s, he lived a long time, he only died maybe a few years ago. He wrote a couple of amazing, amazing biographies, which are half memoir and half creativity instruction manuals, for lack of a better phrase. They just have so much wealth of wisdom in there about making things, exploration, and creativity in general. 

I realized when I was thinking about all this -- that's the stuff that I carry through without even realizing it. So even though I'm not an animator now, and I'm probably never going to be at this point, I realized I still carry all that stuff with me. So I'm going to go through and talk about some of the things that I've traced from his work to mine now, and how that applies to this crazy field I'm working in now. 

So one of the first lessons that I got from him was this idea of "Start Anywhere and Just Stick With It" **(slide 4)**. Seriously, in all of human recorded fictional characters, is there anything that epitomizes stubbornness and sticking with something as much as this guy? (Wile E. Coyote) It is a really powerful lesson. 

I have one of the quotes from his book in here and this is one that I've always really loved. He talked about when he first went to art school, Chuck Jones, in the 1920s: **(slide 5)**. I love this, I think about this, I go back to this anytime I'm learning something new, which, as a web designer and developer, should be all the time. You have to learn something new all the time. If you're not you'll be dead in the water. 

You should learn something new because learning something new is awesome, I love doing it. But at the same time it is a little bit intimidating. I'm constantly learning something or stretching my skills, learning something new. When you first start doing it, my first though is "Wow, I really suck at this, I should stop this and go back to the stuff that I'm good at". But I tend to remember this a lot because it reminds me that ok, yeah, that's true, I do suck at this right now. But maybe I have to suck at it for awhile and get it out of my system. We all have how many bad drawings in us? Everybody does! Every time we start something new, you've got bad drawings, bad lines of code, bad designs, whatever. They're already in you, just like everything else, so the more you do it, the more you stick with it, the more you just get them out of you. 

He says in this quote, it's kind of a "grim edict", but I've always found it to be a really liberating thing. It's like, "Oh! Yeah, I do! I've got bad drawings in me". Everybody's got bad drawings in them so let's get them out and just do that. So that was a really important lesson I keep coming back to whenever I start to learn something new. 

Following onto that, when you get started you need to keep doing it. So, if I dive into a new technology or language or new tool or something like that, and maybe it's not working exactly the way I want it to, or maybe it's a whole other discipline. Right now I'm actually digging way more into development, deeper into the development side than I have before, coming from more of a design, front-end perspective. There are sometimes where I'm like "Wow, do I want to keep doing this? There's so much work involved and I'm not seeing the results from that." Or, the results don't seem to do what I want them to do. 

So these two things go together, and he has a quote about this too, this is a very long quote but I had to put it in here. Before I go in to read it, (so don't read it yet), this guy grew up in the 1910s, 1920s, in California so he had this amazing situation where he literally could go down the street as a kid and watch Charlie Chaplin film his movies. He lived in Hollywood in that era. He has this story of one time his dad came home from doing that, "I was watching Charlie Chaplin down at the studio filming his movies", as you do. And his dad told him this story: **(Slide 6)**

So this is my favorite quote, like ever, talking about all the really horrible work sometimes that is involved in making something new. 

If you want it to seem effortless, if you want people to look at it and just be wowed, say "Wow, that's amazing", there's a lot of work that goes into that, it doesn't just happen. 

There's another really great anecdote that is not from Chuck Jones, but I discovered it first through him. It wraps all these things up. There's this story some of you may have heard, of a rich man who wanted a picture of a crane. So he went to this famous artist and he commissioned it "Make me a picture of a crane, I'll give you $10,000". And the artist said, "Ok, I'll do that for you, come back in a week". And the man came back in a week and the artist said, "I'm not ready for you, come back in another week". And the man said, "Ok". He came back another week and the artist said "Ok, I'm ready for you". He sat down and he took his paper and his ink and he did a picture of a crane in a few seconds. And the man was like, "What the hell was that? I gave you $10,000 and it took you like five seconds!" And the artist gets up, and he goes over to the cupboard and opens the door and there's a thousand pictures of cranes that fall out. 

So all of that wraps up in something that was really important for me to learn. So I learned that you just need to start somewhere, and you need to keep going and you need to have that faith that the more you work on things, the more you're likely to get the result in the end that you need. You have to make sure that your spirit, your reason that you want to do it, is what's coming through, and not all that tiring work. Because there is a lot of tiring work. But there's something that transcends beyond it, and that's what you want to get out to people.


So the other lesson I pulled out of this is the idea of studying individuality and character. I like individuality and character just as a personal thing. It's been an interesting lesson to think about how I incorporate that in my life, how I incorporate that into making things that people use. This particular cartoon **(slide 7)**, I love this cartoon. I love it. This is a cartoon that Chuck Jones directed at Warner Brothers. This bulldog, Marc Anthony, finds this little kitten, which I think is called Pussyfoot, which you never know because they never talk in the cartoon. 

So the big ferocious bulldog, he tries to intimidate the kitty [growls] and the cat just thinks he's wonderful and gives him a kiss and curls up and sleeps on him. 

And the bulldog just immediately falls in love completely, but he's not allowed to bring anything else into his house because the woman who takes care of him said that if he ever brings anymore trash into the house, any more garbage, anything from outside, he's going to get into trouble. So he has to hide his new little kitten from his mistress so that he doesn't get in trouble and the kitten doesn't get taken away from him. 

So it's a six minute cartoon about two animals, they never speak a human word, not at all, there's no dialogue other than the mistress yelling at the bulldog. Chuck Jones talks about this, he's seen people shed tears at this, I've seen it too. 

It's a pretty amazing thing to think that there is a 6 minute bit of film of drawn animals that never speak a word that can move people to that point. Because it just captures something that they can feel, and that they can really relate to. It's so hard not to feel something for this poor dog who loves this little kitty so much that he wants to keep it and he wants to take care of it but he's not allowed to. Finally, he is in the end, and he does. 

It's so simple, but it really touches people. So something that I realized with that is "Wow, there's something really powerful in that". If you want to touch people with what you make, or in any way, it could be something you're doing creatively, maybe a piece of art you're creating, or if you're creating a website or an application, you want people to have a certain experience, you have to think about what they can relate to. What will touch them in whatever way you need that to happen, at whatever level. 

You have to think about the individuals, and you have to think about the individual characters, and what people care about. It doesn't have to be super-complicated to get that message across to people, as long as you're thinking about those people as people, and how you can connect with them like that. 

I have another quote about this. Chuck Jones talks about how you think about human character and human people, and how you find out what these things are that they want. He says: **(slide 8)**. 

This may sound a little bit like "Yeah, I know that, we're all individuals". But do you really know that? Do you really know what makes somebody else tick? How often do we really look around at each other and really look at this person? Think about if you were an animator. The definition of animation is to invoke life, to give life. 

So, even if you're not an animator, you're not a drawing. If you think about somebody else in a sense of "How would I want to animate this person? How would I get a reaction from them?". When I'm talking to somebody, maybe all of you, I want to get a reaction from you, I want to see you light up. I want to see some kind of a connection, from the words I'm saying, or something I'm introducing, or something I'm showing you. 

I don't know you all individually, I would like to at some point. But as an exercise, I'd like to think about everybody individually. What they bring to this. Why are you here? Why are you interested in hearing all this stuff? If I go on to talk to any of you, have that sense of who you really are as a person when you come to there, and how is that animated? How does that go into the talks that I craft, the messages that I send out, the products that I make? How can I tie all that in there so that I am touching people, bringing them into this experience, and understanding them? 

I really feel that having this habit for me, of studying character, studying individuality, thinking of people in this sense really helps me know how to connect and how to make better things for people. 

So another lesson **(slide 9)**. All of these images tie into my lessons in some way, believe it or not. Some of them more so than others. 

I really like this message that I got from a lot of Chuck Jones books about respecting our medium. And this is probably the most specifically applicable to what I do nowadays for my job. 

Here's another long quote that I need to set up, he was such a great writer, he had all these great stories, so I had to pull out long quotes that I have to set up. As Chuck Jones was growing up, again very young boy in California in the 20s into the 30s, his father was always trying to strike it rich. Plot after plot of crazy stuff, he had way more funny examples than I can remember right now. 

But every time his father would start a new business, he would go out and buy a new suit and he would buy a whole bunch of new pencils and a bunch of new stationery with the new business name on it and the business would invariably fail. So, all of the Jones kids had a ton of pencils and paper that had to be used because his dad wanted to get rid of the whole business stuff. 

So they said all of the Jones kids became graphic artists in some way or form, that's what he credited it to. So that leads into what this quote is: **(slide 10)**. 

This is something that really really resonates for me because as I said my path to becoming a web designer was very weird. I don't even know how to describe it. 

I don't have a design background. I learned to design by teaching myself HTML 10 or 11 years ago. I have always been designing in the browser, I've always been working with dynamic things, I've always been making dynamic things. It's been a really interesting experience to realize that that medium has been an essential part of how I learned design. I never learned to design in the traditional sense then translate it to a dynamic medium of a browser or website or application, that's just what I was doing from the beginning.

That's been a really interesting thing to encounter in other people coming from different perspectives on the sense of what this medium really is, what it really involves. 

Really really respecting it, not just because you want to get rid of it, but understanding the limits, the constraints, the possibilities, of all of those things together when you are totally focused on what you're making something with, and not just what you're making, or who is using it. It really opens up doors in the sense of what you can do. Sometimes because you can't do something else. So it really makes you challenge all those limits, makes you think about those things. 

I don't think I would be where I am now if I hadn't really embraced the medium of the web browser and learned to really love it and instead of maybe being angry because of its constraints. So that's what I got out of that particular lesson.

And, leading into that, finding inspiration in imposed constraints **(slide 11)**. I am a big believer, and I think a lot of creative types like to not be so happy with me because of this, I'm a big believer in that thing called the day job. I feel like sometimes having some challenges and not having a place where you are totally supported to be as creative as you want, can be really great for your creativity. Having some constraints in your life where you have to push against things and you have to organize things in a different way. 

There's limits under different circumstances, but I think overall it does awesome things for creativity. One of the things I really like from Chuck Jones stories is also when he was at the animation studio in Warner Brothers back in the 40s and 50s. What used to happen in theaters, some of you may be aware of this, movie theaters used to buy packages from film studios. They would get a movie, they would get a newsreel, they would get a movie trailer, and they would get a cartoon. And you can't just piece by piece, you had to get the whole package all the time. 

So movie studios would make these newsreels, these cartoons, just to go with these movie packages because they had to sell them to the theaters. They didn't have DVDs, they didn't have any of this stuff. 

Warner Brothers didn't care about their cartoon studio at all. They were a necessary evil. "We need this to sell our movies!". There are some horrible stories about how the animation studio was treated in that era. They had no idea that they would be able to reanimate these characters and create all this merchandise for them, that wasn't in the game plan. 

It also wasn't for children, they didn't know that TV was going to come along and they could rerun all these things. None of that, they had no idea. They were making animated cartoons to sell to adults with their movies, and that was it. 

So the byproduct of that is the animation studios were treated really horribly. They had no money, no resources. They were told to make a product and they had to make a product to fit certain constraints and that was it. Period. We don't care about your creativity, we don't care about your precious artistry. You didn't have a place, and they just didn't care.

So an interesting part of this is that in the animation studio, there was no editing, at all. Ever. They, the directors, Chuck Jones, some of the other directors there, had to plan out every frame, and there are 24 frames per second in an animated cartoon, which is 24 drawings per second. For a 6 minute cartoon, they had to plan out every single frame before they made anything because they could not cut later. So everything had to be planned out to that minute level before they did anything at all. They would storyboard it, they would plan it out, and it had to be made that way. When they were done making it, they were done making it. That was it. 

So that sounds kind of awful, right? Because you can't make mistakes, you can't fix anything in post, you can't be like "oh, we'll just take that out later", or "we'll adjust that later". 

But the thing is, you watch the cartoons, especially a lot of the Chuck Jones things, and you can just tell that they were planned out that carefully. Nothing was wasted. They don't waste time, they don't waste movement, there's none of that stuff. It's just a well-oiled machine because it had to be. You have to wonder if it would have been that beautiful or that put-together if they hadn't had those constraints imposed on them that they had to do that. 

This isn't to say necessarily that you have to go into an authoritative area where you're not allowed to explore things, but it is a good reminder to, whatever constraints you have, maybe sometimes it's not a bad idea to put some structure in your own life, your own learning, and see if that helps you get somewhere that you never though you would get before. 

Going along with that, Chuck Jones also says: **(slide 12)**

This is kind of a general follow-up of what I was just talking about. I think that there's also a sense that when you impose those constraints, or embrace those constraints, you're really stripping down to what you absolutely have to have. A lot of times, you don't need the other stuff. Sometimes the other stuff -- a lot of times -- the other stuff is just distracting from what you really need to get across. So it's not a bad exercise to put yourself through that and again embrace those constraints and see what you can get out of that. 

The other big lesson I got was this idea of "do what you love and make your own path" **(slide 13)**. This is something that has come through, I've already kind of alluded to it throughout this whole talk, this is kind of what ties it all together. When I think about the path that Chuck Jones took to get to where he is, we regard him now as one of these masters of animation.

He was one of these people who made this. There are a lot of characters that are staples of our childhood or merchandise, t-shirts you buy that literally would not exist if he did not exist. 

But the thing is that he didn't plan that. When he was a kid, it also didn't exist, just like what I do now didn't exist when I was a kid. So what he did is he went to art school, he talks in his books about how he was literally a starving artist. He and an artist friend had just graduated and they had no food, so they decided that they were just going to steal some food and they stole the first crate that they could off of a truck and found that it was full of celery. They wasted more calories chewing this celery up than they actually could have gotten from it. And that's where he was. And then at some point somebody was like, "Hey, I have this job, you want to go try it out?". And that's how he got into animation.

I don't have exactly the same thing, but there's this sense here of -- I don't know how I got to where I am now. I don't know why I'm doing what I'm doing now. I certainly didn't plan anything, I had no idea that there would ever be a career for me where I would get to make websites or I would get to really interact with any applications that so many people could access. 

I never had any idea that I would be able to get into a career where I could do stuff like this, where I could talk about all these things. It's weird to think about, how did that even happen? 

The best I can come up with is that it just happened because I didn't really think about getting to a certain place or a certain point, or if I did I was ok with being wrong about that. I just really focused on stuff that I liked, stuff that I was interested in, something that I was passionate about. Something that really spoke to me. 

When I was learning HTML, I actually started learning HTML back in the day because I was making websites on AOL Hometown, and I was getting really frustrated that I couldn't make it do exactly what I wanted it to do, because I was using the WYSIWYG editor and I was making my own website, it was probably about film or stuff like that, I'm a big film person. I couldn't make it do what I wanted to do, so I was like, "Fine, I'll just learn HTML then! Take that!". 

I just did it because I wanted to, because I wanted to make something. That was something really exciting to me and I just did that. That was like 2000, maybe 2001 was when I was doing that. I was on a dial-up connection in the middle of rural Ohio. 

My family were all very working class, construction, truck drivers. They're like, "What are you doing? This is ridiculous." I was 20, I was taking time off from school because I didn't know what I wanted to do, and they're like, "You're sitting on the computer making websites, this is ridiculous.". 

It probably was, I don't particularly blame them for those opinions, but at the same time I really liked it. I really liked making things. I thought it was really exciting. It was really cool to be able to type things into the computer screen, into my Windows Notepad editor and have it do things. It was awesome, I really liked that. 

I just kept doing that, and I really stuck to it, and I had no idea that it would ever get me anywhere. It's still debatable I guess whether it has, I guess I've done ok. I didn't try to get to a certain place or be a certain thing. I was kind of lucky because I didn't have that to even look at. But looking back, I am, I feel like I'm really lucky and glad that I didn't know where I was going. Because I didn't get locked into an idea of what I had to do.

Now, I do a lot of educational initiatives and things like that, and I see that some of that can be to people's detriment, like "I'm going to do this thing, I'm going to do this right here." While I admire the dedication and the determination of that, that's an awesome thing, at the same time, being open to something that you never though would happen is even more awesome. 

It really is, because I think that openness, that sense of, "I'm just going to focus on what I love, I'm going to trust that that's going to evolve into something that will sustain me" -- it might not always work out, that's totally an option. That's part of the risk of it, though, that's part of the sincerity of what you're doing. 

I think if you don't have that risk involved, then you may not have that extent of sincerity that you could possibly go to. So when you're thinking about making things, about being creative, about what you'd like to learn, what you'd like to try next, I think that having that element in there of openness, of risk, of being willing to let go of your ideas of what you think you have to do to discover something that you never knew existed is really, really powerful and really, really important.

**(slide 14)**


It is a little cheesy, I guess. I don't know, but I really believe in this. I really truly believe that it's more about finding what you really want to do and how you want to express yourself. Just doing that, and finding a way to make it work. I think that's what education is really about, developing yourself and going on to do new things, make new things. It really comes down to this. 

**(scene missing)**

...the really strange route to get where I am, and it's totally not what I though it was going to be many years ago. 

But, at the same time, it is kind of, in a way. I still manage to connect some of those dots, but it has nothing to do with what I'm actually doing, or where I was going, or what decisions I was making. It's just who I was being, and how I was expressing that, and just being frank and being honest about that, and being open about that. 

So in a way, I am doing exactly what I always though I would be doing, in that sense. You realize that there's all these different layers and levels there, and what really matters is not that superficial level that we all focus on -- I'm getting this degree, I'm getting this job, I'm going to work at this company, I'm going to make these things. There's nothing particularly wrong with any of that, it's all good. But there's a layer underneath things. 

What's the impetus behind that? How does that connect to you, or what you're doing? Where's the common thread there? I really feel that even if you feel like there's nothing there; you could be like, "There's no similarity between what I thought I wanted, or who I was, or what I'm doing now or any of that stuff", I really think there probably is. If there isn't a similarity, maybe that's a good indication that you need to try something else. 

So I would challenge you to think about that, and think about what you used to want to do, who you used to be. Is there a common thread now to what you're doing now? If not, then why not? What is there that you could reinterpret and make sense of for you now. Or, try something new in that sense. 

Having said all that, I wrote a blog post about this this is the link to that if you want to check it out: **(slides 15/16)**. 

It has a lot of the same points that I talked about here. It also has cartoons on it! So I highly recommend you check that out, especially if you're not familiar with Chuck Jones and his work. I have about five videos in there, some of my favorite cartoons. 

Again, I'm a film person so I like to be like "they're not cartoons, they're animated films. They're films, you should treat them like films". I would really encourage you, if you would like to get more into his actual work, to check that out. And these are the two books he wrote. All the quotes and all the stories I took are from those two books. They're both really, really great. They really are. He was an amazing writer and he has so many stories in there about his life and this era that's far removed from ours now. In lots of ways, I mean how many people even do hand-drawn animation anymore, much less lived in the 20s and the 30s in Hollywood in that era? So many interesting perspectives. 

I didn't mention this in there, but the other thing you may know that he's done; he also directed "How the Grinch Stole Christmas", the animated series, he was a good friend of Theodore Geisel. He had all these amazing stories and they're all in his books so I think that even if you aren't into cartoons, you would still get a lot out of that.
