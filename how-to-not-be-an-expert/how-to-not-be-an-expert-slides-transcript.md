"Authority is supposedly grounded in wisdom, but I could see from a very early age that authority was only a system of control and it didn't have any inherent wisdom. I quickly realised that you either became a power or you were crushed" - Joe Strummer

"You don't necessarily have to have talent, you can just get up and do something and see where it takes you. I always tell girls who say they want to start a band but don't have any talent, well, neither do I. I mean, I can carry a tune, but anyone who picks up a bass can figure it out. You don't have to have magic unicorn powers." - Kathleen Hanna

things I've learned so far

**Slide 13**

if you teach someone a thing, she'll know a thing; or you can teach her how to learn things and she can learn lots of things herself.

**Slide 14**

education is primarily about teaching people to get out of their own ways.

**Slide 15**

unlearning old expectations is more difficult and more terrifying than learning new information.

**Slide 18**

"Like most of the others, I was a seeker, a mover, a malcontent, and at times a stupid hell-raiser. I was never idle long enough to do much thinking, but I felt somehow that my instincts were right. I shared a vagrant optimism that some of us were making real progress, that we had taken an honest road, and that the best of us would inevitably make it over the top. At the same time, I shared a dark suspicion that the life we were leading was a lost cause, that we were all actors, kidding ourselves along on a senseless odyssey. It was the tension between these two poles -- a restless idealism on one hand and a sense of impending doom on the other -- that kept me going." - Hunter S. Thompson

**Slide 19**

my experts are questioners and searchers and explorers and learners and beginners and fuck-ups and risk-takers and punks and freedom fighters and rebels with causes.
