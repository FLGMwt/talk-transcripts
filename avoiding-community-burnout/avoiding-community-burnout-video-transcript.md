Community burnout

So I wanna start out with a little bit of a confession, with something that happened to me, I guess it's something I do, you may not, I don't expect everybody to understand it, because it's really a kind of bizzare thing that happens. I don't know if any of you have probably even seen it, but sometimes I get really irrtated by what people write on the internet, you probably have no idea, like you'ven ever seen or heard anything like that, but it happens to be a lot, and sometimes, there's a reason for it, or sometimes justifiable sometimes not, but I think it happens a lot in a community and there's twitter and you know, all kinds of blogs and there's tumblr and there is hackernews and everybody's got opinions and they have very strong opinions and they usually argue about those opinions. And so we have a whole bunch of opinions going on in a community and sometimes it gets really loud and sometimes it gets hard to figur out what we're talkign about and are we talking to peopl how is that all working out? And then we go to conferences liek thisl you oknow yyer passionate people, you're here on a saturday and you like talkign to people who like the samethings you do and are apssionate about things too. 

You probably have opinions as well, you probably have arguemtns and things like that. This isn't a bad thing,right?, we have passion in this community, we have passionate people who want to fight for what they thing is right even it's something it could be somethign trivial it could be your fav tool you ahve your afvorite reasons why it's your fav tool you ahve really good reasons why you like that particular tool and you watn to talk about hem with other people.

that's not in a sense abad thing like it's good to be excited about hings 

buty you know there's other thigns going on in a community too that it could be something very small like tools it could be something that we could make a joke out of or it could also be something like bigger problems or community that we need t  address and deal with

I was thinkign about something that I would treat as a jok. Im' a designer and a front-end person so my favorite hoobby onthe internet is making fun of developers who buy apple laptops and put stickers all over them

this amazing masterpiece of modern, industrial designa nd you put stickers all over it. and I'm like, I like to do that, and all the other developers here like to do that and that's... that's a joke. I think we can handle that in a community, most of them can. Some of them are just a little confused about it which I understand that too.

you know something like that goes on and that's just kind of cool. You know there's other things that kinda go on too and 

Last year, I was at Confluence in actual two different professional things, there was a work thing, there was a conference I was at. And both times I had people come up to me and talk to me about my husband and his work and what we were doing ther and I was like "I don't know what you're talking about" and they just assumed I was at this conference or I'm at his worker day because I'm there I'm there for my husband and not because I'm there to work or speak. 

And so that seemed like a community thing that we need to talk about a little bit more or not make a joke out of. Why are there assumptions like that in our community?

Am I really a part of the community? Are there assumptions I shouldn't be here for some reason? I know there's lots of things that we could challenge, that we could talk about

The thing is when we have all this stuff going on and we have all these people with passion and experience and we need to talk about this and assumptions and this big huge mess of thigns, we can get really, really tired *. It's really ahrd to try to get back to connecting with people and you know away from all the jokes and away the assumptions and away from all the other stuff that's going on in the community.

I get really tired sometimes. Trying to talk about all taht stuff and t rying to make sure that I' mconnecting with people. I meank, it's hard! It's hard for everybody. But, my options are to figure out a way to do that or not be in this community anymore. But I want to be a part of this community because there's really cool stuff here

So when I think about the thigns that  would like to chagne, to challenege to make better, that I can connect with other people, I Don't realize that i ened t ocom up with sustainable ways to do that. SO how do I do that

So I'm going to tell you what I figured out as I went along

And really the way I should have done this

This is a pretty freeform talk, if you have anything you'd lik to chip in ask or anything like that, please feel free to do that. And this is going to be a lot about experiences.I aslo want to preface this by sayting that I don't think there are any real solutions that would work for every situation or every person, those just don't exist

The things i"m toign to go through are thet hings that worked for me. Hoepefullt there's things that will help other people, but you know, your mileage may vary on that.

So ther first thing that I thought is a really good thing taht I ened to do is I need to make sure that I always pay attention to the good stuff. So, instead of being wrapped up in what somebody's posting in the comments in hackernews, which is usually really stupid... and it is! and you could say that it's really stupid but at the same time, people are doing really cool stuff. I know people athat are doing really cool stuff and every time taht I hear  about a bad sitaultion regarding you know,  sexism or other activist causes that I work to fight agaisnt there's a bunch of other people that are doing really coold work to make that stuff better. Not that we want to ignore the bad stuff but we need to put effort in to making sure that we're appreciating the poeple that are doing the good work. That makes me happy that they're out therer and it makes them happy if someone takes the time and the thought really off of the assholes and be like " you know what, you deserve some credit too, you're doign good stuff." it just makes me happy to see that happen all around.

Make sure that if you feel that you're in the middle of messes that you don't know how to handle or there's too much negativity going on, take a step back, make sure youre taking care of your friends and that your'e not doing it do do somthing thoughtless that may ahve inadvertently made them feel * community. And we can reach out to new people * and so you know, we don't want all the bad apples * to define who we are. BEcause we're not * not the assholes on HackerNews. We're all of these really great people. SO reach out and express that and bring people in.

And you probably had people who did that for you at some point. I know I did. And sometimes we forget to acknowledge that. * Go thank the epople that helped you and even if there's someone out there that you've never intereacted with, maybe you've seen them speak at a conf. I have people all the time who say like "I saw you speak but I didn't know if I'd come upa and talk to you" or something like that and I'm like "that's what Im' here for". I'm here doing this so I can connect with ppl in the community. 

SO reach out to those epople. Just take the time to thank them for what they do and create that connection. So. If you're doing all these thigns and making sure that you're talking t opeople and appreciating the things that they're doing. When a problem comes up, it doesn't have to be a big * because you alsways have these * okay, we can deal with this and address wthis becasue we're all epople and we've made these connections * let it go. and * problem comes up, as it will, we'll be ing better shape to deal with it. * keep going back to it after that. So balance it out with the good stuff that you have and you'll feel better *

The other thing that I found really helped me is do something about it. If you see somethign taht bothers you, whertere it's great or * If you dont' think it's great, you knw, do somethign about it

I found that when I was  frustrated about being the only woman in the room not having another woman that I could go to to ask questions in this community or things like that. A couple years ago, I started a chapter of Girl Develop it in Columbus Ohio and we do programming classes aimed at women beginner programming, HTML, things like that. And I took taht action adn I built something. And I built a new community of people who are actively reaching out and solving a problem taht was affecting me..

That made a huge difference in how I felt about that. I was actually doing something. I wasn't just kind of being lik "ow man, that really sucks and I hate this Why is this that way, I don't like that I want it to be different" So do somethign that makes a difference. And there are so many different ways you can do that. You don't have to go build a whole new organization. Or do this great * shift. There's aslo

You * here. I did a website I just put together a few weeks ago. I twas called *. Basically what I did as I went to the olunteer listings on idealist.org and there are a ton of non-profits taht need developer help, design help, they need websites ,* applications, and they're looking for people who want to help. So I made al ittle site and I gathered the ones taht are teh most promising. It's kind of the same

There's a lot of bad stuff that you read on the internet. Here's an opportunity just go do something about it, just put some good karma into the world, you'll help out somebody with the skill that oyu ahve. Whcih are pretty grea. not everybody has the skill taht you have. Ou have the ability to change things, to build thigns. So go find somet pplace that needs your skills and so something.

* problem that you're concerned with or that's hurting you directly, but you know, it'll help cause osme balance al ittle bit. You can also do things like mentor or teach. It's the same thignI talked about hearlier, tyouk now reaching otu and talking to people. There are so many people taht are looking to elarn what you tknow. They are * desparate. So just * to reach out to them and show them where to get started and help them throug htat is amazing.

And it maeks you feel really awesome. How many epople have * teaching? I mean, * classrooom? IS ther anybody that doesn't like it? It's a little bit of a loaded question, thank you for not messing it up. 

But I knwo that, for me, teaching it's amazing to bring somebody in and help them learn how to do somethign taht they didn't know ohow to do evore and seeing their excitement and what it means to them to now have these oower s, these skills. It makes me, taht's what I lvie for. thats' awe4some *amke oyou feel better if * you can give that to people

on the other hand, learnsomething neow yuourself . There are so many thigns that are being created all the time . ant a n unbeliveable pace. There is alsways something that you can learn. I mean if there's soemthign that you dont' thing that you cant' learn. I said befroe I'm a designemr * I did a lot of talkign about how developers * design at that  *casry. *You need to understand code

So ther could be something, it's not just about learning , it's not just about learning a new language, * but keep in mind that there's lots of things to elarn. You could learn about philosophy * even if it  * helps * you will be more calm or excited or ahowever you feel about goign to wlrk aagin *

*just be open to learning

Go make something. It doesn't ahve to be something for someone else> It doesn't have to be something that's going to be a big huge deal. Just go do something. Put something out in the world taht didn't exist before. Do somethign taht'lll ift your seprirts make you feel better****

This is abig one. This is probably the thing wthat I struggle with the most. So if I get angry with a situation. You know whta's that all about? When I look at a sitaution that I should be angry at. * that's wrong. Somebody * maybe there's injustice going on. I feel that i should be angry. I don't want to be "Well, I can't do anything about it" * because it doesn't help you to be angry all the time. If you're angry and just angry. Then you're going to just burn yourself out.

It's kind of like this example. So kind of like the Hulk is * But Iv'e learned to keep control of it. If you just let yourself be angry and * actions follow from that, that's when * rampant desctruction * hurting people who don't deserve it. The hulk is not the hero because * I'm a little bit irritated by the * of hulk smash. It'l like yeah, he does, but that's not a good thing * superheor. hes' not a super becasue he smashes thing he's a super because control * good.

So if ;you're just smashing and you're like well but I'm anrgry and I deserve to be angry so I'm going to smash things, there's not hign * about that. You have to learn how to smash appropriately. Otherwise, it's just not going to * want.

So the thing that I've learned about anger. YOu should feel * fel. * health. But you ahve to process and you have to take responsibility fo it. And you have to * Smashing shit up.

Another thing that I have owrked on a lot in thte past couple yaers. is practicing compassion and respect. aND THIS is something * lie * hulk smashing to loving people. But, there are two sides of the same coin. And the same with compassion and respect, it's funny, I feel like when I talk about these issues with these bpeople, I get more pushback on the compassion and respect thing than I do with like the controlling anger and it's not becasue we don't want to be compassionate and respectful eople * well if somebody did something wriong, then I don't want to be compassionate, I want to * smash. Why should I respect somebody if * don't speak up do anytthig about it, * change.

And I get where they're coming from with that but that's not really * go about things. And that's very closely tied to the anger issue. It kind of * in the same process. You can feel anger and kind of see something that's wrong, but think about this empathy thing and thinkign about how it does not happen in a vacuum. * You can separate your judgement about an action * word or a anything really, an assumption. and you can separate that about what you * separate thigns.

So practice the compassion and that doesn't let them off the hook, that just makes you make sure that you're not going to be doing anything like they did just because you're angry or * role of *.

Be kind to people, it's I'm your kindergarten teacher and I"m trying to each you how to play nice in the playground> *overly * we're all just nice to each other and everythign is cool. * not that simple, but yet, sometimes, it is that simple. SO if you think about that on a regular basis, * how you're treating epople * empathetic to what's goign on wtih them. * start doing that to you as well and then you won't have this* assumptions, you on't have clashes and conflicts becasue they're seeign what youre doing.

You also have to udnerstand who you are, how you function and you know how what's best for that. Every ione of us processes things different and communicates thigns different ways* you have to put a lot of time and effort into understanding who you are * don't misunderstand. You know we can have that empathy going back and forth , but you can't reallyd o that if you don't know who you are or what you dwant or *best and all those things.

* personally, I do not * from conflict. Ever. Conflict completely * me. Some people are not like this. Some peopel really like conflict. Somepeople really love going into battle and * huge arguments w/ people and that's that's their thing. The thing is if you don't that's your thing and you don't know whta other people's things are and you go and * conflict and you * don't confront or anything like that. * each other becasue you're not communicating * that.

I learned about my self that I was trying to * conflict to you know, * change they though was necessary I couldn't participate in a community like tat* me out.

I realized that I work a lot better if I can do this * thing> and that's what sustains me * the work that I want to do. So I have to understadn about that * other people. * how I work in the ocmmunity and how I work together.

This is not * hyappy and fuzzy. sometimes I think that * if you feel * If you really feel that you don't want to deal with any comments and you don't want to deal with the frustrations anymore. * passions out of control * leave.

I think that what I mean by leave is just makign sure that you're giving yourself enough room. Just take a step back and see the whole sitaution. It's just that understadning with yourself * no point* community if they're not really feeling that they should be *

So take a break. Just get away from it. You don't ahve to give up * all this tutff* change. Or like it's not going to happen. * You don't have to do it in a large scale thing. * if you want to. And maybe you'll fee * enoguht to go back*

I say this to women all the time* I don't want to leave the field * Don't feel the * you need to do what's right for you. * You're not helping other women by being the role model of a martyr. SO if you need to leave, then leave. Take a step back and figure taht out * bettter of in a different path. We should not make people feel ashamed for that * for it. 

I know that "be the change you want t osee in the world" is really really cliched. If you want a change to happen in your community, if you thinkg the community should be more this or that, you need to do taht yourself first first. It's the only way to get taht started. Adn this is something definitely that ties into everything else I talked about, about kindness, respect and controlling anger and things like that.

I would not be stadning out here tell you all to do this, you know to try this if I'm not * myself. That would not be anything right a thing for me to do. So I've learned that if I want to chare these thigns with the community and suggest things as thigns that we can do, I ened to make sure that I'm doing them myself, I realized I don't know a way to tell you that, and there's also the sense taht not even what I'm  specifically saying.

and I learned this from this is my daughter *. She is seven eyars old, I am teaching her HTML, she has her HTML tag here. As a parent and I'm a single parent * issue. * I learned very very quickly that she pays way more attention to the things taht I do rather than the things I say. I say things and if I go off and do opposite, she immiediately picks up on that, that * is the thign that she * to follow. I learned very quickly that * you should behave like this, you should do these things. If I'm not living those every second*she's watchign me all the time. She's learning from me how to be in that world and I don't want her to go out into the world and into larget community and not be practicing* .I want her to know how to do allthis stuff so that she can navitage and learn her own things. I learned that the first thing that I have to do is make sure that I"m doing every thing that I say I think other people should do because * is watching me.

And that's okay in a non-creepy way. There are oter people that are looking fo r that and sayign well does that work? Everybody is watching you in a community, again, in a non-creepy way*regular bassi, you have no  idea * behaving oppositely, people are picking up on that. * gonna see if you do * you don't actually * believe in. They'll see that disconnect* . so keep that in mind that you need to be taht change because * paying attention*

And that's all I have for you.
