Start anywhere and stick with it.

"My first instructor at Chouinard Art Institute, like Nicolaides at the Art Students League, greeted his beginning classes with the following grim edict: 'All of you here have one hundred thousand bad drawings in you. The sooner you get rid of them, the better it will be for everyone.'"

__Slide 6__

"One evening I lost faith in both my father and Chaplin when my father came home to tell us that he had seen Chaplin shoot a single fifteen-second scene 132 times. … 'Why,' I asked myself, 'not do it right in the first place? Can't he learn how to do it by watching his own movies?' … It was the beginning of my understanding of the two primary rules of all creativity. _The first is you must love what you are doing; the second is that you must be willing to do the often dull and tiring work necessary to bring each creative endeavor to completion, and in that endeavor only the love should show._ It took Chaplin more than a hundred takes a thousand times to bring his incredible craft to the screen he loved so well, and never, never did the work show."

Study individuality and character.

"_Character always comes first_, before physical representation. We are not what we look like. We are not even what we sound like. We are how we move; in other words, our personalities. And our personalities are shaped by what we think, where we come from, by what we have experienced. And that personality is unique to each of us."

Respect your medium.

"We were forbidden - actually forbidden - to draw on both sides of the paper. Because, of course, Father wanted to get rid of the stationery from a defunct business as soon as possible, and he brought logic to bear in sustaining his viewpoint: 'You never know when you're going to make a good drawing,' he said. And then, stretching credulity to the point of idiocy: 'Suppose you were Leonardo da Vinci and you painted the _Mona Lisa_ on one side of your canvas and _The Last Supper_ on the other - how would you ever hang it?' Nevertheless - and perhaps, just perhaps, he knew what he was saying - he brought into focus a most vital rule of creativity: _You must, if you ever pretend to artistry, respect your medium; be it a blank piece of paper or canvas, an untouched bar sheet, an uncarved piece of stone, or an exposed frame of film_."

Find inspiration in imposed constraints.

"The whole essence of good drawing - and good thinking, perhaps - is to work a subject down to the simplest form possible and still have it believable for what it is meant to be."

__Slide 13__

Do what you love and find your own path.

[Title overlaid on a still cartoon image of Michigan J. Frog dancing with his top hat and cane.]

__Slide 14__

"The rules are simple. _Take your work, but never yourself, seriously_. Pour in the love and whatever skill you have, and it will come out."
